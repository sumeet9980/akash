            <p id="p1">HTML is Hyper Text Markup Language. 
        
                It is the basis of most of the documents on the web. 
                HTML documents contain text content, which is text you see when you are looking at the web page, 
                and markup, which is the instructions for how the text should be displayed on the webpage.</p>

                 how it should be formatted. Usually these instructions or elements have both an an opening or 
                 closing tag. The exception is void tags, which have no content and so don't need a closing tag. 
                 If a tag is not void, it needs a closing tag, or whatever instruction the tag gives won't stop.
            Elements: Individual components of HMTL documents. Elements are either inline or block. 
                Block elements have a sort of "box" around them that allows you to write code with instructions
                 on style. For example, you can set height and width.

            Attributes: These are properties or values of an HTML element that modify it. For example, "href" 
                is the attribute that tells the browswer that the text content of the element should be
